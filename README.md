# CS573_DataMining

The project involves using Machine Learning to predict Loan Defaulters. 

Formulated a classification model to identify potential loan defaulters to minimize financial risk.
Involved data wrangling, visualization, model selection, and tuning.
Dealt with imbalanced data to eliminate bias, studied ROC-AUC, precision, and recall to decide optimum thresholds and compare models.
Used clustering to identify risk identification factors and segment population. Random Forest model performed best. Precision and Recall was used to select the final model.
